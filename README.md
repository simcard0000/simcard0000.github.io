# simcard0000.github.io
ðŸŒƒ Simran's personal website!

### About
This is `v4` of my personal website, wherein I also re-uploaded various site files. The largest original part left from previous versions is the project table. This is a handmade site hosted on GitHub (via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) as well as deployed, built, and hosted through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - a basic architecture diagram is provided below.

### Credits
* The star chart on the website is generated via [VirtualSky](https://slowe.github.io/VirtualSky/), a library by [Stuart Lowe](https://github.com/slowe/VirtualSky) (and powered by  [Las Cumbres Observatory](https://lco.global/)).
* The latest game and song information on the website is from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/), respectively. Steam has a [Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) with a function where one can retrieve [recently played games](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetRecentlyPlayedGames_.28v0001.29) from a user. I also listen to music on Spotify, but it was much simpler to connect my Spotify profile to a Last.fm account and then use Last.fm's API to get [current song information](https://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getRecentTracks), rather than use Spotify's API directly.
    * To hide API keys and other sensitive user information that was necessary for using the aforementioned API functions, they were made secrets on Netlify's systems and abstracted away using [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/).
* Site iconography was made using [Canva](https://www.canva.com), and the font is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).
* Site inspiration from: [https://www.yihui.work/](https://www.yihui.work/) and [https://kevinnchen.com/](https://kevinnchen.com/).
